    // You are going to write a booklibrary application.
    // Use the scala language features you have learned so far.

    // Requirements:
    // - Library consists of a collection of books. For inspiration see photo, or use your own books.
    // - The library has members, called 'readers'.
    // - A book is either on the shelf at the library or with a reader
    // - When a book is not on the shelf, there can be a waiting list of multiple readers
    // - When a reader returns the book and there are other readers waiting, the book is automatically assigned to the
    //   reader waiting the longest.
    // - A book can be at a reader for 3 weeks maximum.
    // - The library doesn't like readers who return books too late. No reminder emails are send,
    //   but when the reader returns the book too late, he will be removed from the member list of the bookstore.
    //   (Hint: he should also be removed from waiting lists if necessary).
